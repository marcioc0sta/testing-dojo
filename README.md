## React testing dojo
___
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To run the test: `yarn test` or `npm run test`. For your convenience when you 
are writing your tests we do recommend the watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
# or
yarn test:watch
```

From watch mode you can filter for your tests to not run all tests everytime, 
just follow your terminal
